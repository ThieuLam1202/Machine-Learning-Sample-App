# Machine-Learning-Sample-App

Console app for deploying ONNX Machine Learning model using ML.NET.

Note: Since the ONNX model being too large to be pushed to GitHub, we can recreate the model from this repository: https://github.com/ThieuLam1202/ONNX-Convert

The model path in Program.cs can also be modified for proper ONNX model location on desktop.
